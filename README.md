# ha-tesla

Draft and Work in progress. Will clean up as we go along. 

Add following to configuration.yaml

homeassistant:
  packages:
    !include_dir_named packages

copy packages ( including files in it ) into the /config directory

restart HA
    
Integrations required
- Nordpool for pricing
- Tesla
- Tesla Wall Connector ( That is what i am using ). Reading out energy added from Tesla not "good" enough
- Something to read out your P1 Consumption and Production
- Something to read power generated by Solar
